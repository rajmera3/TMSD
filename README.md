# Customer Delivery Documentation: Time Machine Space Dinosaur
##### Team 8326
Time Machine Space Dinosaur (TMSD) is a tool contracted by Tobias Wilson-Bates, an LMC professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Interested in the bidirectional relationship between science fiction and academia, in the past, Professor Bates has asked for multiple projects to help understand when and where one influences the other - for example, science fiction inspiring titans of the industry.  The TMSD website, specifically, helps literary researchers and science fiction enthusiasts understand the relationship, either causal or correlational, between terms appearing in science fiction and in academia. In contrast to existing research aids, TMSD creates a dynamic, templated list of terms with graphs and sources to provide insightful and valid information.

Website built using [Swiftype App Search Demo](https://github.com/swiftype/app-search-demo-react)
Line graph built using [Chartkick](https://github.com/ankane/react-chartkick)

## Release Notes
*Version 0.1.0*
New software features:
* Search functionality for terms
* Visualization for each term via line graph for science fiction and academia
* Definition and first usage date for each term
* Request a new term as user
* Admin page to approve new terms and add to database

Bug fixes: First version so no bug fixes

Known bugs and defects:
* No partial searching- must include the full word of the term to search for it
* Missing visualization for termâ€™s frequency across genre i.e. how often a term appears in computer science journals
* Must reload admin page to see the new pending requests. Does not dynamically update.

        * ``> python3 -m virtualenv venv``
        * ``> .\venv\Scripts\activate``
        * ``> pip3 install -r requirements.txt``

Installation of actual application:
1. Download credentials file (service_account.json) to read/write from database
    * __You must have access to the Firebase console (Sign in with timemachinespacedino@gmail.com account). To request access, contact tgbates@gatech.edu.__
    * Go to [Firebase Admin SDK console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/tmsd-577fd/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk)
    * Press "Generate new private key"
    * Rename the downloaded file to "service_account.json" and put inside "webscraper/" directory

Run instructions: 
1. Open two terminal/command prompt windows at root directory
2. Run flask app in the first window:
    * Mac/Linux:
        * ``$ cd webscraper``
        * ``$ source venv/bin/activate``
        * ``$ python3 server.py y``
    * Windows:
        * ``> cd webscraper``
        * ``> .\venv\Scripts\activate``
        * ``> python3 server.py y``
3. Run website server in the second window:
    * Mac/Linux:
        * ``$ cd website``
        * ``$ npm start``
    * Window:
        * ``> cd website``
        * ``> npm start``
4. The website should automatically open in your browser. If not, go to http://localhost:3000/

Troubleshooting: 
1. __Q: I am on Windows and I can't run the command "pip3".__
    You may not have installed Python3 correctly on your computer. Make sure to go to [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install using the recommended settings to download Python3 and pip3 as well as add them to your environmental path. More details can be found [here](https://vgkits.org/blog/pip3-windows-howto/)
2. __Q: I get a "ModuleNotFoundError" when running the flask app using python3.__
    You should have installed all the required modules in the "Build instructions" using a virtual environment. Make sure your terminal or command prompt has (venv) in front of it. If it doesn't, run ``source venv/bin/activate`` on Mac/Linux or ``.\venv\Scripts\activate`` on Windows.
3. __Q: I try to run ``python3 server.py y`` but get this error: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'service_account.json'__
    Make sure
